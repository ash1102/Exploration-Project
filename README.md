# Legacy Rising Curriculum

Legacy Rising is a cohort-based curriculum that guides participants from unmanaged destructive cycles to operating as builders—people who can convert intensity and pain into structured action, self-regulation, contribution, and long-term legacy.

## Transformation Statement
By the end of the program, participants can:
- Recognize destructive loops without shame.
- Regulate energy and nervous system states sufficiently to sustain effort.
- Make aligned decisions under stress.
- Take consistent action toward a self-chosen build (business, project, or community contribution).
- Relate to others without collapsing, rescuing, or disappearing.

## Core Principles (Non-Negotiables)
- **Dignity-first**: No pathologizing, labeling, or identity reduction.
- **No shame, ever**: Insight without safety is destabilization.
- **Builder identity over symptom management**: We cultivate agency.
- **Structure before scale**: Regulation and coherence precede ambition.
- **Explicit beats implicit**: Assumptions must be named.
- **Integration > insight**: Insight without action does not count as progress.
- **Choice over coercion**: Participation is voluntary; pressure invalidates outcomes.
- **Mixed-experience community**: People with and without addiction histories learn together.

## Curriculum Modules
0. **Orientation & Container**: Psychological safety, program norms, consent, and expectations.
1. **Pattern Recognition: Cycles Without Shame**: Mapping destructive cycles without blame.
1.5. **Personality & Energy Profile (Required Intake)**: Constraint mapping for regulation styles and risk zones.
2. **Builder Identity Formation**: Shifting self-concept to builder identity.
3. **Energy & Regulation**: Practical nervous-system regulation for consistency.
4. **Obsession → Strategy**: Channeling intensity into bounded, ethical action.
5. **Entrepreneurship & Creation Foundations**: Value creation, constraints, iteration, and responsibility.
6. **Money, Time, and Reality Contact**: Honest constraints, tradeoffs, and sustainability.
7. **Relationship, Community, and Contribution**: Builder identity in relationships and community.
8. **Integration & Legacy Path**: Continuity plan and legacy narrative.

## Learning Objectives (Global)
- Identify and interrupt destructive cycles.
- Regulate enough to sustain action.
- Make decisions aligned with long-term values under pressure.
- Translate insight into repeatable behavior.
- Participate in community without losing self or control.

## Constraints
- **Time**: Cohort-based, 8–10 weeks, 2–3 hours per session, limited between-session workload.
- **Audience**: Adults with mixed backgrounds and varied trust in institutions.
- **Cognitive load**: New concepts must be revisited at least twice; limit 1–2 core ideas per module.
- **Emotional load**: Regulation and grounding precede confrontation; no forced disclosure.
- **Ethical boundaries**: Not therapy or medical treatment; clear referral boundaries.
